Compare your implementation of the StudentMap in Ex02 to an ArrayList,
a BinaryTree, and a HashMap. Does your implementation always
perform better than the others? If yes, explain why.
If not, explain in which cases your implementation
could perform worse. Consider for this comparison only the
operations put, get, and delete, defined in the interface MyMap.



What is the performance of the method “getByName”
compared to the operations defined in the MyMap interface?

StudentMap
Best case, when the tree is balanced, the operations put, get and delete will have time complexity of
O(log n) - the array-part of the Studentmat is a constant. When dealing with a small dataset it will be slower than. But when dealing with a large data set it will outperform Arraylist and Binary Tree

Hashmap will always have time complexity of O(1), will always outperform.


worst case, when the tree is unbalanced, it will a time complexity of O(n).
It will perform same as ArrayList and Binary tree.

The performance of the method "getByName" will have time complexity of O(n) as perform a linear scan in the search for node with matching name.
